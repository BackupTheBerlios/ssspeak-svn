<h5>LICENSE FOR THE MBROLA PROGRAM</h5>

<p>
This program is being provided to "You" the licensee,
by Faculte Polytechnique de Mons - Thierry Dutoit, the "Author", 
under the following license, which applies to any program or other work 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may 
be distributed under the terms of this license. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work.
</p><p>
By obtaining, using and/or copying this Program, you agree that
you have read, understood, and will comply with these terms and
conditions :

</p><h4>Terms and conditions for the distribution of the Program</h4>

<p>
This Program may not be sold or incorporated into any product
which is sold without prior permission from the Author.
</p><p>
When no charge is made, this Program may be copied and distributed
freely, provided that this notice is copied and distributed with
it. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy or distribute the program subject
to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.
</p><p>
If you wish to incorporate the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Author
to ask for permission. 
</p><p>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license,
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license.  If
you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as
a consequence you may not distribute the program at all.  For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
program.

non-military purposes, with and only with the voice and language
