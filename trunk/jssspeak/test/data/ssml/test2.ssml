	    <p>The <emphasis>Feynman Lectures on Physics</emphasis> is a three volume collection of an experimental two year series of class lectures given
to freshman and sophmore <mark name="a0"/>physics students at <mark name="a1"/>Caltech university given by <mark name="a2"/>Richard Feynman in 1962.
The collection was then published two years later when professional physicist <mark name="a3"/>Robert Leighton edited the text into book format.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Feynman Lectures on Physics</emphasis> are perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics. His
original lectures were so popular that by the end of the first semester, there were more regular attendees that weren't
officially registed for the class than were.</p>
<p>The collection is now commonly considered to be the classic introduction to modern physics, including information on <mark name="a4"/>mathematics, <mark name="a5"/>Newtonian
physics, <mark name="a6"/>quantum physics, and even the relation of physics to
other sciences. The six most readily accessible chapters of the book were later compiled into a book entitled <emphasis>Six Easy Pieces:
Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher</emphasis>, and the next six hardest in <emphasis>Six Not So Easy Pieces:
Einstein's Relativity, Symmetry and Space-Time</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The first volume, for example, shows how to solve the N-body differential equation for the motion of the planets <mark name="a7"/>numerically, a feat which would have impressed <mark name="a8"/>Isaac Newton. The second volume is mainly on <mark name="a9"/>electrodynamics and <mark name="a10"/>electromagnetism. The
third volume, on <mark name="a11"/>quantum mechanics, shows, for example, how the
<mark name="a12"/>double-slit experiment contains the essential feature
of quantum mechanics.</p>

<audio src="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/ssspeak/content/ssspeak/helpers/sound/click.wav"/>Feynman once commented, about these three volumes: "<emphasis>[This set of books] has views which are very close to my
