<DIV TYPE="paragraph">The <PITCH BASE="+20%">Mongol Invasion of Russia</PITCH> was an invasion of the medieval state of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Kievan Rus' by a large army of nomadic <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Mongols, starting in
<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1223. The invasion precipitated the breakup of Kievan Rus' and influenced development of
Russian history, including rise of the <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Moscow principality.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">As it was undergoing fragmentation, Kievan Rus' faced its greatest threat from invading Mongols. In 1223 an army from Kievan
Rus', together with a force of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Turkic <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Polovtsians (Cumans), faced a Mongol raiding party at the <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Kalka River. The Kievan alliance was defeated soundly. Then in <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1237-<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1238 (after conquering of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Volga Bulgaria in 1236), a much larger Mongol force overran much of Kievan Rus'. In <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1240 the Mongols sacked the city of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Kiev and then moved west into <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Poland and <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Hungary. Of the principalities of Kievan
Rus', only the Republic of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Novgorod escaped occupation, but it paid tribute to the
Mongols. One branch of the Mongol force withdrew to <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Saray on the lower <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Volga River, establishing the <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Golden Horde. From Saray, the Golden Horde Mongols ruled Kievan Rus' indirectly through their princes and tax
collectors.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">The influence of the Mongol invasion on the territories of Kievan Rus' was uneven. Centers such as Kiev never recovered from
the devastation of the initial attack. The Republic of Novgorod continued to prosper, however, and a new entity, the city of
<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Moscow, began to flourish under the Mongols. Although a Russian army defeated the
Golden Horde at <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Kulikovo in <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1380, Mongol
domination of the Russian-inhabited territories, along with demands of tribute from Russian princes, continued until about
<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>1480 (see <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Great standing on the Ugra river).</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Historians have debated the long-term influence of Mongol rule on Russian society. The Mongols have been blamed for the
destruction of Kievan Rus', the breakup of the ancient Russian nationality into three components, and the introduction of the
concept of "oriental despotism" into Russia. But most historians agree that Kievan Rus' was not a homogeneous political,
cultural, or ethnic entity and that the Mongols merely accelerated a fragmentation that had begun before the invasion. Historians
also credit the Mongol regime with an important role in the development of <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Muscovy as
a state. Under Mongol occupation, for example, Muscovy developed its <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>postal road network,
<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>census, fiscal system, and military organization.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Kievan Rus' also left a powerful legacy. The leader of the <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Rurik
Dynasty united a large territory inhabited by <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>East Slavs into
an important, albeit unstable, state. After Vladimir accepted <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Eastern
Orthodoxy, Kievan Rus' came together under a church structure and developed a <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>Byzantine-Slavic synthesis in culture, statecraft, and the arts. On the northeastern periphery of Kievan Rus',
those traditions were adapted to form the Russian <AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/link.wav"/>autocratic state.</DIV>

<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Industrial output also increased by 75%, and the Soviet Union became the world's largest producer of oil and steel. The twenty years following Stalin's death in 1953 were the

spreading rapidly across Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</DIV>

<DIV TYPE="paragraph"><PITCH BASE="+20%">For further details see Soviet economic development.</PITCH></DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">During the later years of the Brezhnev era, however, the Soviet economy (<PITCH BASE="+20%">see</PITCH> Economy of the Soviet Union) began to stagnate and
the population increasingly began demanding greater quantities of consumer goods.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">In the postwar years, the Soviet economy had entered a period of intensive growth (based on productivity improvements), with a
new set of challenges from those of the extensive growth (mobilization of capital and labor) of the Stalinist era.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">As the Soviet economy grew more complex, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures (plan targets)
and factory inputs. As it required more communication between the enterprises and the planning ministries, and as the number of
enterprises, trusts, and ministries multiplied, the Soviet economy started stagnating. The Soviet economy was increasingly
sluggish when it came to responding to change, adapting cost-saving technologies, and providing incentives at all levels to
improve growth, productivity and efficiency.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">At the enterprise level, managers were often more preoccupied with institutional careerism than with improving productivity.
They received fixed wages and only received incentives for plan fulfillment on the basis of job security, bonuses, and benefits
like special clinics and private dachas. Managers received such benefits when targets were over-fulfilled, but when, for
instance, they were <PITCH BASE="+20%">greatly</PITCH> over-fulfilled, they only saw their control figures increased.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Hence, there was an incentive to exceed targets, but not by much. Enterprises often understated capacity in order to bargain
for more advantageous plan targets or control figures with the ministries (targets that, of course, would be easier to
implement).</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Another problem was that production quotas usually stipulated the quantity of goods to be produced by a given factory but not
the quality. Therefore managers were often tempted to meet their production quotas by sacrificing the quality of the goods they
produced. Thus much of the output of the Soviet economy was of very low quality by international standards. This led to the
frequent problems of badly made machinery breaking down, and disrupting the rest of the economy.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Planning was also very rigid; plant managers were not able to deviate from the plan and were allocated certain funds for
certain capital and labor inputs. As a result, plant managers could not improve productivity by laying-off unnecessary workers
due to such labor controls. There was substantial underemployment due to controls in plans drafted during collective bargaining
between enterprises and ministries.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">At the enterprise level, incentives were lacking for the application of price-saving technology. Planners would often reward
consumers with lower prices, rather than rewarding the enterprise for its productivity gains. In other words, technological
innovation would often fail to make the industry more profitable for those who had a stake in it.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">The Khrushchev and Brezhnev years saw concessions to consumers: wages for workers were relatively high, while prices were kept
down at artificially-low administratively-set levels. Yet income levels rose far more rapidly than price levels, despite slow
productivity gains. As a result, supply shortages were increasingly common.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">The Cold War was another drain on the consumer economy. With a far smaller
economy than the US, the Soviets faced an uneven burden in the arms race, forcing the country to devote a far higher share of
their society's resources to the defense sector.</DIV>

<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/header.wav"/><PITCH BASE="+20%">Calls for reform</PITCH>.<BREAK/>




Leonid Brezhnev


<DIV TYPE="paragraph">As the political atmosphere gradually moved toward becoming more relaxed since de-Stalinization, a reform movement high up
party ranks was still able to survive the ouster of Khrushchev in 1964.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Most remarkably, the market-oriented reforms of 1965, based on the ideas of Soviet economist Evsei Liberman, and backed by Soviet Prime Minister Aleksei Kosygin,
were a attempt to revamp the economic system and cope with problems increasingly evident at the enterprise level. The Kosygin
reforms called for giving industrial enterprises more control over their own production-mix and some flexibility over wages.
Moreover, they sought to turn the enterprises' economic objectives toward making a profit, allowing them to put a proportion of
profit into their own funds.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Until the late 1960s the Soviet Union was still sustaining higher rates of growth than the Western powers. With this in mind,
some Soviet and Russia specialists have argued that the Kosygin Reforms of 1965 - not Gorbachev's reforms in the 1980s - were the
last chance to spare the leadership of the Soviet administrative command economy and to spare the population of the hardships of
the past twenty years.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">However, the style of the new leadership posed some problems for its own reform policies. The collective leadership sought to
reconcile the interests of many different sectors of the state, party, and economic bureaucracy. As a result, the planning
ministries and the military - the sectors most threatened by Kosygin's reforms - were able to obstruct efforts for reform
considerably.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Fearing a move away from detailed central planning and control from above, the planning ministries - whose numbers were
proliferating rapidly - fought back and protected their old powers. The ministries controlled supplies and rewarded performance,
and were thus a formidable element of Soviet society. To maintain their grip over industry, planners started issuing more
detailed instructions that retarded the reforms, impeding the freedom of action of the enterprises.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Kosygin, meanwhile, lacked the strength and the support to counteract their influence. Since these reforms were aimed at
increasing productivity by pushing aside surplus labor, support from workers was minimal. Although enterprise management stood to
gain the most from the reforms, their support was lukewarm, given their fears that the reforms would eventually falter.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Finally, by 1968, there was the unfortunate example of the Prague
Spring in Czechoslovakia. By the early 1970s, the party's power
vis-à-vis the economic bureaucracy and the military was weakening considerably. Momentum for economic and political reform
stalled considerably until the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid-1980s.</DIV>

<DIV TYPE="paragraph">By 1982 the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that
the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the US throughout the 1970s, but the system was not yet ready for drastic change.
The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although
hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.</DIV>

<AUDIO SRC="file:/home/tshalif/src/mozilla/talext/content/talext/helpers/sound/header.wav"/><PITCH BASE="+20%">The Andropov interregnum</PITCH>.<BREAK/>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Two days passed between Brezhnev's death and the announcement of the election of Yuri Andropov as the new general secretary, suggesting to many outsiders that a power struggle had occurred in the
Kremlin. Once in power, however, Andropov wasted no time in promoting his supporters. In June 1983, he assumed the post of chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, thus becoming the ceremonial head of state. Brezhnev had needed
thirteen years to acquire this post. During his short rule, Andropov replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and
regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. But
Andropov's ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his poor health and the influence of his rival Konstantin Chernenko, who had previously supervised personnel
matters in the Central Committee.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Andropov's domestic policy leaned heavily toward restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical
political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to
those that had been associated with Kosygin in the mid-1960s. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an
anticorruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Andropov also tried to boost labor discipline.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">In foreign affairs, Andropov continued Brezhnev's policy. U.S. -Soviet relations began deteriorating more rapidly in March 1983, when U.S. President Ronald Reagan dubbed the Soviet Union an "evil empire." Soviet spokesmen decried Reagan's "bellicose, lunatic" anticommunism.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Andropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he died in February 1984 after disappearing from public view for several months. His
most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two
years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel
allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point,
Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to
the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.</DIV>

<DIV TYPE="paragraph"/>

Konstantin Chernenko with Leonid Brezhnev


<DIV TYPE="paragraph">At seventy-two, Konstantin Chernenko was in poor health
and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But
Chernenko's short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into
corruption undertaken under Andropov's tutelage came to an end. Chernenko
advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture.
He also called for a reduction in the CPSU's micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB
repression of Soviet dissidents also increased.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">Although Chernenko had called for renewed <PITCH BASE="+20%">détente</PITCH> with the West, little progress was made toward closing the rift in
East-West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles, retaliating for the United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In the late summer of 1984, the
Soviet Union also prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader Erich
Honecker. Fighting in Afghanistan also intensified, but in the late
autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="paragraph">The poor state of Chernenko's health made the question of succession an acute one. Chernenko gave Gorbachev high party
positions that provided significant influence in the Politburo, and Gorbachev was able to gain the vital support of Foreign
Minister Andrey Gromyko in the struggle for succession. When Chernenko
died in March 1985, Gorbachev was well positioned to assume power.</DIV>
